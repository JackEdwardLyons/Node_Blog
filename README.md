# Node_Blog
A simple blog application using Node, Express and MongoDB.

This project was part of a Web Development Certificate where I was challenged to create an application which followed RESTful routing best practices.
In this simple blog application users can post, edit and delete blog posts, which will be displayed on the main page wall.
